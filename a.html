            <h2>What is Coffee for you?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Coffee is a blend of sensory experiences and culture. It's that rich, aromatic drink that symbolizes energy, warmth, and comfort. 
                    On one hand, it's a ritual; the morning cup that wakes you up or the shared moment in a caf√© with friends. 
                    On the other hand, it's a source of focus and creativity, helping to clear the mind for a study session, a task, or even conversation like this.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>For most people, moderate coffee consumption (about 3-4 cups a day, providing up to 400 mg of caffeine) 
                    is considered safe and may even offer health benefits. However, exceeding this amount or consuming it 
                    with added sugar, cream, or sweeteners can lead to potential health risks. If you have certain health
                     conditions (e.g., hypertension, anxiety disorders, or pregnancy), you might want to limit or avoid coffee altogether.</li>

                    <li>Moderate coffee intake generally refers to consuming about 3 to 4 cups per day, which provides up to 400 mg of caffeine. 
                        This amount is considered safe for most healthy adults and is associated with various health benefits, including improved cognitive function, 
                        reduced risk of certain diseases, and enhanced physical performance. </li>

                    <li>Anxiety and Insomnia: High caffeine intake can increase anxiety, disrupt sleep, and lead to restlessness.</li>
                    <li>Dependence and Withdrawal: Regular consumption can lead to dependence, with withdrawal symptoms like headaches, irritability, and fatigue when consumption stops.</li>
